                        Technology has revolutionized commerce, reshaping the way businesses operate and consumers shop.

                        One of the most significant impacts of technology on commerce is the rise of e-commerce. Online
                        shopping platforms have made it possible for consumers to browse and purchase products from the
                        comfort of their homes, at any time. This has not only increased convenience for consumers but

                        Resource Planning (ERP) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have made inventory management
                        more efficient. These technologies help reduce costs, improve accuracy, and speed up the
                        delivery process. <br>

                        secure, quick, and convenient transactions. Digital wallets, contactless payments, and
                        cryptocurrency are some examples of how technology has modernized payment methods. <br>
